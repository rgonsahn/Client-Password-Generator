# Client-Password-Generator


# Introduction
    This project was created to assist a prospective client, with keeping confidential data secure , by generating a unique password with a password generator. The password generator will prompt the user with an array of questions and based on the user's response a password will be generated.     


# Built With
    The project was built using:
    javaScript 
    html 
    css 

## Geting Started
    Ensure that your OS has the Chrome web browser installed. The generator runs best in google chrome. 

## Description
    JavaScript functions, variables , and methods were used to make the password generator dynamic. I used the split method frequently in my code to satisfy the task. By setting a listed password criteria to a variable and assigning it a corelating string I was able to split the string into a substring (a component of the randomly generated password without changing the original string), by (",") at the end of the function, the given character will split between other characters when generated to create the final password. For-loop function was used in lines 60-64. For-loop was used to ensure the required amount of characters was generated each time.
